# GenericConsole
A generic Arduino Leonardo drive station console with POV, joystick, and switch handling.

This is intended for a supplementary console on an FRC drive station that may employ rotary switches (translated to POV settings), 
potentiometers (joysticks) and switches (buttons) to provide static (non-momentary) controls.
